The joint projects each will receive $250K over two years in institutional funding, as administrators seek external investors interested in advancing exciting pediatric translational research with commercial viability. One dream team will be based at Drexel, with Dr. Throckmorton as the principal investigator of the “Giving Kids a Chance” project that will investigate a new intravascular blood pump for pediatric patients with congenital heart disease (CHD). Drs. Barbee and Spiller are members of a second dream team based at CHOP, with Robert J. Levy, MD, as the principal investigator of a research project titled “Pediatric Transcatheter Valve Replacements: Preventing Device Failure due to Structural Degeneration" that also will focus on CHD with a concentration on Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF). These “blue babies” have insufficient oxygen and need cardiac surgery early in life. </p><hr style="border: none; border-bottom: 3px solid #BBBBBB;"/><p><strong>July 15, 2014</strong></p><h2 style="line-height: 27px"><a style="text-decoration: none; color: #006699" href="//thetriangle.org/news/study-explores-brain-injury-recovery/">Dr. Joshua Jacobs and Colleagues Receive a Multi-Site Grant for a Study on Brain Injury Recovery</a></h2><table align=center border=0 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=5><tr><td><a href="//thetriangle.org/news/study-explores-brain-injury-recovery/"><img height=150 style="border: 1px solid #BBBBBB;" src="images/people/jacobs.gif"/></a></td></tr></table><p>Dr. Joshua Jacobs, assistant professor in BIOMED, will join a $22.5 million, 4-year research project titled “Restoring Active Memory,” in which he will explore the use of brain stimulation to help recover memories and cognitive abilities of people who have suffered a traumatic brain injury. The research is funded by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) and is affiliated with President Barack Obama’s Brain Research through Advancing Innovative Neurotechnologies initiative. This large-scale project is coordinated among seven hospital sites, including Thomas Jefferson University (TJU), the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania, Dartmouth University, Emory University, NIH, the Mayo Clinic, and the University of Washington. Dr. Jacobs is involved in the TJU hospital site. </p><hr style="border: none; border-bottom: 3px solid #BBBBBB;"/><p><strong>June 05, 2014</strong></p><h2 style="line-height: 27px"><a style="text-decoration: none; color: #006699" href="">Raha Dastgheyb Wins 1st Place in the Graduate Poster Presentation Category at the 2014 Northeast Bioengineering (NEBEC) Conference</a></h2><p>Raha Dastgheyb, PhD candidate in BIOMED (Advisor: K.
