Drexel University has been ranked among the 50 Best Master’s in
Biomedical Engineering (BME) Degrees
*****************************************************************

Philadelphia, PA – December, 2017

College Choice, a leading authority in college and
university rankings and resources, put Drexel University at #24.
Here is the full ranking of the Best Master’s in Biomedical
Engineering Degrees 
( https://www.collegechoice.net/rankings/masters-in-biomedical-engineering-degrees/ )
.

The School of Biomedical Engineering, Science, and Health
Systems is an internationally renowned center for research and
instruction. As its name suggests, the school places a particular
emphasis on collaboration among scientific disciplines. Students
benefit from alliances not just within the University but with
other agencies, major research centers, universities, and
businesses, including FDA, Fox Chase Center Research Institute,
Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, Thomas Jefferson University,
the University of Pennsylvania, Johnson & Johnson, Exponent, and
Integra Life Sciences.

The MS in Biomedical Engineering degree program 
( http://drexel.edu/biomed/academics/graduate-programs/biomedical-engineering-master-of-science-degree/ )
 curriculum develops graduates who can identify and address
unmet clinical, diagnostic, and healthcare needs by using their
knowledge of modern theories, engineering systems, and
mathematical and engineering tools. Biomedical engineers require
the analytical tools and broad knowledge of modern engineering
and science, fundamental understanding of the biological or
physiological system, and familiarity with recent technological
breakthroughs.

According to College Choice, the ranking is based on
accreditation and three composite scores: institutional
excellence, student satisfaction, and return on investment. The
data from their ranking comes from the National Center for
Education Statistics’ IPEDS database, U.S. News & World Report,
Payscale, and individual college websites.

In its description of Drexel University, College Choice
noted the Hartwell Foundation recently awarded an associate
professor

 in the School of Biomedical Engineering with a grant to
continue her research to aid children with heart defects.
