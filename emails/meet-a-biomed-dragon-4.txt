At Accepted Students Day you will have the opportunity to meet many of our faculty and current BIOMED students and participate in a hands on, interactive biomedical engineering activity designed to introduce you to the challenges and discoveries that biomedical engineers are a part of every day.  Meet one of our current BIOMED Dragons now…
