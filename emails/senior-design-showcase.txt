Dear Friends of Drexel Biomed,

Please join us to celebrate our graduating seniors! We are
delighted to invite you to the Spring 2017 Senior Design Showcase
of Drexel University's School of Biomedical Engineering, Science
and Health Systems (BIOMED)! This event will be held from 4-7 pm
on Wednesday, May 17, 2017, on our University City Campus at the
George D. Behrakis Grand Hall.

This event will showcase the highly innovative biomedical design
projects of our more than 130 graduating seniors and their
interdisciplinary teammates in celebration of their
accomplishments. Many of these projects started with clinical
shadowing to identify unmet medical needs, followed by rigorous
engineering design of an innovative solution, iterations of
prototypes, and testing of the built solution. Several of these
student-driven design projects are pursuing intellectual property
protection. During this event, students will also compete for
Design & Innovation Awards supported by BIOMED and your generous
donations, which are greatly appreciated. This will ensure the
continued success of our students and their design-centered,
experiential education to develop life-saving solutions.

Hors d'oeuvres and non-alcoholic beverages will be served during
the event. Here is the schedule of the Spring 2017 Senior Design
Showcase below:

4:00 PM – 4:15 PM – Showcase Event Registration
