Dear Graduating Students,

We acknowledge that nothing can replace the traditional
in-person Commencement ceremony that you all deserve. That is why
the School is committed to providing a traditional Commencement
ceremony when it is safe and feasible to do so, either in the
Fall or at the following Commencement in June 2021.

Presently, we are preparing to provide the best possible
experience to recognize and honor all graduating BIOMED students’
outstanding growth and achievements.

1) Beginning Wednesday, June 10th, our BIOMED Class of
2020 Recognition & Honors website 
( https://drexel.edu/biomed/news-and-events/events-calendar/commencement-announcement/?utm_source=email&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=2020_commencement&utm_content=announcement )
 will be available for all friends and family of graduating
students. The website will include:

* Video message from the Dean (Paul Brandt-Rauf, ScD, MD,
DrPH)
* Video messages from Associate Deans (Fred Allen, PhD and Andres
Kriete, PhD)
* Video ‘Reading of the Names’ of all graduating BIOMED students
* Senior Design Showcase page
* Graduate Students Showcase page

2) Accessible now is the BIOMED Class of 2020 Virtual
Yearbook 
( https://drexel.edu/biomed/news-and-events/events-calendar/commencement-announcement/flipgrid/?utm_source=email&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=2020_commencement&utm_content=flipgrid )
. This interactive experience is made possible by Flipgrid, a
video discussion platform for educators. Graduating students are
invited to record a video message to reflect on a favorite moment
at Drexel, to thank a family member, or to a thank a faculty
and/or staff member. On June 10th, a link to view the Virtual
Yearbook will be added to the Virtual Commencement website. We
hope this will empower every voice to be heard in a way that is
not usually possible at commencement.
