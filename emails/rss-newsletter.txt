Drs. Peter Lewin, Richard B. Beard Distinguished
University Professor and Director, Biomedical Ultrasound Research
and Education Center (PI), Leonid Zubkov, and Michael Neidrauer
(all in BIOMED), and Drs. Michael Weingarten (CoM), Rose Ann
DiMaria-Ghalili (CNHP), Juan Muniz (CNHP), and David Margolis
(UPenn) are developing an ultrasound device to speed the process
of healing chronic wounds that was featured on WTXF-TV (FOX-29)
on January 18, 2017. The research team has developed a portable,
battery-powered applicator that heals wounds with low-frequency
ultrasound and received a $3 million NIH grant to cover the cost
of the next phase of analysis, which includes testing the method
on 120 patients during the next five years.

Amanda Pentecost, dual PhD candidate in MSE and MS in
BIOMED (Advisors: Y. Gogotsi and K. Spiller), was awarded a 2016
Whitaker International Fellowship to conduct research with Dr.
Kwangmeyung Kim in the Center for Theragnosis at the Korea
Institute of Science and Technology (KIST) in Seoul, South Korea.
Amanda's dissertation research focuses on using theranostic
nanoparticles to increase the effectiveness of a common
anti-inflammatory drug, dexamethasone, in preventing fibrous
capsule formation and isolation of an implanted biomaterial.

Drs. Karen Moxon, professor and associate director for
research in BIOMED (PI), and John Bethea (CoAS – Co-PI), received
a 5-year mult-PI $3M NIH R01 grant for the project titled
“Enhancing Supraspinal Plasticity to Improve Functional Recovery
After Spinal Cord Injury.” It is becoming increasingly evident
that plasticity within supraspinal networks, induced by
therapeutic interventions, is necessary for optimal recovery of
function after spinal cord injury.
