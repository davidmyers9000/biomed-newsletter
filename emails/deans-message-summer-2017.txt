Dear Friends,

As the end of our fiscal year approaches, I reflect on the many
amazing successes we have accomplished here at the School of
Biomedical Engineering, Science and Health Systems. As the
inaugural dean, I am proud of our talented students and faculty,
and I want to share a few of those stories with you.

Bob Schultz is a current PhD student, who works under the
advisement of Yinghui Zhong, PhD. Bob’s research aims to
regenerate spinal cord tissue. In addition to conducing
groundbreaking research, Bob, like many other of our students,
also serves our community in West Philadelphia by sharing his
expertise in teaching and mentoring grade school students in
science and engineering.

I’m also proud of Carli Moorehead, a BS/MS student in our School
who is working on a project titled “Developing ‘Smart’ Bone
Implant Materials for Improved Regeneration and Repair” with
Simone Spiro, PhD. Carli and Dr. Spiro will work on the project
at the Institute of Science and Technology in Ceramics in Faneza,
Italy. They will be working on iron-doped hydroxyapatite
nanoparticles and scaffolds to tune magnetic and biological
properties for drug delivery and bone tissue engineering. Carli
is also one of three Drexel Biomed students that have been
awarded a prestigious Fulbright US Student Program Grant for the
2017-18 academic year.

These stories are just a sampling of the astounding achievements
our students and faculty members have been able to accomplish in
the past year.

As we reflect on our accomplishments, I hope you will join me
and hundreds of other donors in supporting the School through a
personal gift to ensure our successes continue well into the
future. Please find a return enveloped enclosed, or give online
at drexel.edu/biomed 
( http://drexel.edu/biomed/about/make-a-gift/ ). If you would like
to discuss giving via phone or in-person, please contact my
colleague Lauren Anglum ( lauren.anglum@drexel.edu ) at
lauren.anglum@drexel.edu.

Sincerely,
