As You Gain Quantitative Skills

******************************
MS in Biomedical Science (BMS)
******************************

Our MS program in Biomedical Science (BMS) is ideal for
students from non-engineering disciplines who wish to expand
their career path choices beyond the traditional biomedical
science opportunities and via rigorous quantitative skills
preparation.

The curriculum enables students to gain the necessary
knowledge to concentrate in Biomaterials and Tissue Engineering,
Bioinformatics and Systems Biology, Neuroengineering and
Neuroscience, or Biomechanics and Human Performance during the
second year of the program. Upon completion of the BMS program,
participants are able to successfully work on interdisciplinary
teams with engineers and clinicians in academic and industry
settings. With the guidance of a dedicated advisor, student, can
further individualize and enrich their curricula by adding a
complementary Graduate Minor 
( http://catalog.drexel.edu/graduateminors ), completing a research
project under the guidance of a faculty member, and/or
participating in Graduate Co-op 
( http://drexel.edu/scdc/co-op/graduate ) to gain valuable industry
experience prior to graduation.

The core requirements 
( http://catalog.drexel.edu/graduate/schoolofbiomedicalengineeringscienceandhealthsystems/biomedicalscience )
 for the BMS encompass approximately 45 course credits (most
courses are three credits each) and can usually be completed
within 2 years. Graduates of the program work in fields such as
health care, pharmaceuticals, medical devices, biotechnology and
others; continue clinical training in medicine, dentistry, or
veterinary medicine; and/or pursue further graduate study, such
as a doctorate degree.

Accepted students often hold undergraduate degrees in:

* Biology
* Chemistry
* Biochemistry
* Biomedical/Biological Science
* Computer Science
* Mathematics
* Public Health
