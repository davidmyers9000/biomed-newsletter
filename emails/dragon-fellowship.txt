NEW! BIOMED Dragon Fellowship
*****************************

The coronavirus crisis has put a spotlight on the
importance of science in supporting our nation's well-being. The
need for expertly trained biomedical engineers and biomedical
scientists has never been greater or more urgent. In order to
enable more students to reach their goals of obtaining a graduate
level degree, The School of Biomedical Engineering Science and
Health Systems launched a new scholarship – BIOMED Dragon
Fellowship. The BIOMED Dragon Fellowship will provide up to $7500
of tuition assistance to MS level students who want to build
their talents and help us change the world by advancing
biomedical engineering and science.

Scholarship recipients are selected on the basis of
academic record, demonstrated leadership and participation in
extracurricular activities, honors, work experience and statement
of goals and aspirations.

As an accepted student no additional supporting
documentation is necessary - if you wish to be considered please
reply to this email as soon as possible.
