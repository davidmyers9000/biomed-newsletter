Description
-----------

The Insight Fellows Program is a training fellowship
designed to bridge the gap between academia and a career in data.
Insight provides seven-week, full-time, training fellowships in
Silicon Valley, New York, Boston, and Seattle. They offer a full
tuition scholarship, dedicated office space, and project-based
learning under the guidance of top industry mentors. Over 800
Insight alumni are now working at Facebook, Apple, LinkedIn,
Reddit, Netflix, NBC, MTV, Khan Academy, Biogen and other top
companies.

Insight Data Science ( http://insightdatascience.com/ )
provides a unique opportunity for PhDs and postdocs working
quantitatively with data to translate their skills into those of
data scientists, build portfolio projects, and get jobs with
leading data-driven companies across a multitude of industry
sectors. In this talk we will provide advice for students
thinking of making the transition and discuss the Fellowship
program.

Insight Data Engineering provides a unique opportunity
for programmers to learn more about open-source, cloud-based
distributed systems software through hands-on project work, and
then helps those programmers land awesome data engineering jobs.
This talk will focus on strategies that students, who are not
currently working in the field of data engineering, can use to
break into this cutting-edge industry. We will also discuss the
Insight Data Engineering Fellows Program.

The information session will include abundant time for
Q&A with Data Science Lead and Drexel alumnus, Greg Antell and
Director of Product, Yan Kou, who will be leading the discussion.

( http://insightdatascience.com/faq ) page for more information and
answers to common questions.
