Senior Design Showcase 2018

Dear Friends of Drexel Biomed,

-->

---------------------------
2018 Senior Design Showcase
---------------------------

* Friday, June 1, 2018 at 5:00 – 7:30 PM
--------------------------------------

George D. Behrakis Grand Hall

3210 Chestnut Street

Philadelphia, PA 19104

Join us to celebrate our graduating seniors! This event
seeks to showcase the highly innovative biomedical design
projects of our more than 110 graduating seniors and their
interdisciplinary teammates in celebration of their senior year
capstone design achievements. Many of these endeavors started
with clinical shadowing to identify unmet medical needs, followed
by rigorous engineering design of a novel solution, iterations of
prototypes, and testing of the built solution. These exciting
projects address unmet therapeutic needs and quality-of-life
altering, real-world problems through design innovation. During
this event, students will also compete for Design and Innovation
Awards supported by the School of Biomedical Engineering, Science
and Health Systems and your generous donations.

Hors d'oeuvres and non-alcoholic beverages will be
served during the event. Agenda forthcoming.

To attend, please register no later than Friday, May
25, 2018.
