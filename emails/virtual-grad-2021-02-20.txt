---------------------------------------------------

In today’s world, the need for more biomedical engineers
and scientists has never been greater! From the cleaning
solutions used to disinfect hospital surfaces, through the
ventilators helping keep patients alive, to the development and
production of vaccines, biomedical engineers and scientists play
a big role in humanity’s efforts to fight COVID‑19, and beyond.

With expertise spanning physiology, biology,
bioinformatics, biomechanics, and engineering, biomedical
engineers and scientists combine their diverse skills to create
life-enhancing, life-saving solutions to solve worldwide health
issues (including the current pandemic), helping improve how
patients are treated and lowering the cost of care. If you would
like to join the ranks of professionals helping engineer a better
tomorrow, please join us to learn about the MS in Biomedical
Engineering, MS in Biomedical Science, and MS in Bioinformatics
programs at the School of Biomedical Engineering, Science and
Health Systems on Saturday, February 20th at 10 AM.
