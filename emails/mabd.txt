Meet a BIOMED Dragon Alumni â€“ Aarti Kamath
===========================================
MS in Biomedical Engineering with Graduate Co-op option
-------------------------------------------
Hi! My name is Aarti Kamath and I completed a MS degree in biomedical engineering at Drexel University. I started in the MS program in September 2014 in order to learn about medical devices, and today, as I look back I am sure I made the right choice. The curriculum of the program allowed me the flexibility to choose the courses that focused on my area of interest and that are crucial in propelling my career in the area of medical device development.

My experience at Drexel was different than that of my friends at different universities - I graduated with a MS degree AND also with almost 7 months of hands on professional experience at a world-renowned pharmaceutical device company. I completed the graduate co-op options offered in the MS in biomedical engineering and biomedical science program and found a paid co-op (internship) position with B.Braun Medical Inc. in Allentown, PA. During my co-op I was able to apply what I learned in the classroom and gain many additional new skills while making significant contribution to the healthcare industry. After graduation I was swiftly offered a full time position with B. Braun Medical Inc.

About Graduate Co-op Option at Drexel University
-------------------------------------------
This optional program enables students to accept paid positions in their career fields - and receive academic credit. Employment opportunities are available in 3 or 6 month installments; the program is an option for both domestic and international students. Additional information can be found at http://drexel.edu/scdc/co-op/graduate/.

Our co-op option is an ideal choice for students who are interested in pursuing industry employment after graduation.

The Bureau of Labor Statistics projects the employment of biomedical engineers is projected to grow 23 percent from 2014 to 2024, much faster than the average for all occupations. Growing technology and its application to medical equipment and devices, along with an aging population, will increase demand for the work of biomedical engineers.

Please let me know if you have any questions about our MS in Biomedical Engineering or MS in Biomedical Science with the graduate co-op option!

Best wishes,
