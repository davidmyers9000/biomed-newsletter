MS in Biomedical Engineering with Graduate
Co-op option

-->

Dr. Kara Spiller gave a talk titled
Harnessing the Inflammatory Response for Tissue Regeneration; she
discussed the work her laboratory (Biomaterials and Regenerative
Medicine Laboratory at Drexel University) is currently conducting
to understand the mechanisms by which the inflammatory response
orchestrates successful tissue regeneration, and to develop novel
biomaterial strategies that apply these principles to situations
in which tissue regeneration is impaired.

Seminar (known as BMES 864) is a first year
graduate course required for all MS and PhD students; the course
introduces students to faculty’s research as well as the research
of local, national and international collaborators and partner
institutions.

Kara Spiller, PhD

Assistant Professor

Dr. Kara Spiller is an Assistant Professor in
Drexel University's School of Biomedical Engineering, Science,
and Health Systems. A member of the first class of Drexel's
accelerated BS/PhD program, Dr. Spiller received bachelor's and
master's degrees in biomedical engineering from Drexel University
in 2007. As an NSF Graduate Research Fellow, she conducted her
doctoral research in the design of semi-degradable hydrogels for
the repair of articular cartilage in the Biomaterials and Drug
Delivery Laboratory at Drexel (PI: A. Lowman) and in the Shanghai
Key Tissue Engineering Laboratory of Shanghai Jiao Tong
University (PI: W. Liu). After completing her PhD in 2010, she
conducted research in the design of scaffolds for bone tissue
engineering on a Fulbright fellowship in the Biomaterials,
Biodegradables, and Biomimetics (the 3Bs) Research Group at the
University of Minho in Guimaraes, Portugal (PI: R.L Reis). She
then conducted postdoctoral studies towards the development of
immunomodulatory biomaterials for bone regeneration in the
Laboratory for Stem Cells and Tissue Engineering at Columbia
University (PI: G. Vunjak-Novakovic), before returning to Drexel
in 2013. Her current research interests include cell-biomaterial
interactions, the design of immunomodulatory biomaterials, and
international engineering education. Dr. Spiller is looking for
graduate students to join her laboratory in the Fall of 2017!
