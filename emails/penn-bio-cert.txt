Drexel University | School of Biomed

* Gap year option that fills a critical gap in the
medical curriculum for future physicians (and continued education
for current physicians)
*  UPenn students enrolled in the post-bac program are guaranteed
admissions!
* Can be completed in 1 (gap) year
* Includes 4 courses (2 required and 2 chosen from a list of
electives; for details see: Course Catalog 
( http://catalog.drexel.edu/graduate/schoolofbiomedicalengineeringscienceandhealthsystems/bioinformaticscert/ )
) and an optional research component (under the mentorship of a
faculty at Drexel, UPenn, or CHOP).
* Certificate can be applied towards a MS, or PhD in Biomedical
Engineering or Biomedical Science at the School of Biomedical
Engineering, Science and Health Systems

Extensive molecular and biological patient data is
increasingly included in diagnosis and treatment and its
interpretation is crucial for the future of precision and
personalized medicine. The increasing adoption of genomic and new
genomic data sequencing in clinical labs requires that healthcare
professionals, in particular physicians, be equipped with the
knowledge and skills to understand and interpret genomic and
other high-throughput ‘omics data for patient care.1

The Advanced Certificate in Bioinformatics at the
School of Biomedical Engineering, Science and Health Systems at
Drexel University enables post-bac students to gain the
bioinformatics expertise prior to formal medical education, thus
making the participants aware of computational tools and
techniques available to them very early in their medical
training.1

The Advanced Certificate in Bioinformatics at the
School of Biomedical Engineering, Science and Health Systems at
Drexel University emphasizes a systems engineering approach to
provide a foundation in systems biology and pathology informatics
(tailored specifically to students with post-bac/pre-med
background). Students are provided with hands-on experience in
the application of genomic, proteomic, and other large-scale
information to biomedical engineering, as well as experience in
advanced computational methods used in systems biology. The
Certificate includes 4 courses and an optional research component
and can be completed in one year.
