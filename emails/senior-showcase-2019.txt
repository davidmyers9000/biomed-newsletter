Biomed Senior Celebration and Showcase
--------------------------------------

Behrakis Grand Hall

Join us to celebrate our graduating BS, MS, and PhD
students! This event seeks to showcase the highly innovative
biomedical design projects of our graduating seniors and their
interdisciplinary teammates in celebration of their senior year
capstone design achievements. Many of these endeavors started
with clinical shadowing to identify unmet medical needs, followed
by rigorous engineering design of a novel solution, iterations of
prototypes, and testing of the built solution. These exciting
projects address unmet therapeutic needs and quality-of-life
altering, real-world problems through design innovation. During
this event, students will also compete for Design and Innovation
Awards supported by the School of Biomedical Engineering, Science
and Health Systems and your generous donations.

Hors d'oeuvres and non-alcoholic beverages will be served
during the event.
