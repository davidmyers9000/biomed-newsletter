Biomedical engineering takes the top spot in best MS degree
category
*****************************************************************

"A master’s program can be a great way to switch careers
or build momentum in your current track. But it’s important to
think hard about what you’ll get out of a graduate degree before
you make the investment, because some master's degrees are much
more valuable than others.

Every year, Forbes turns to compensation site PayScale to
reveal the best and worst master’s degrees for jobs. PayScale 
( http://www.payscale.com/ ) creates a sophisticated ranking that
uses seven factors: early career pay (median pay for workers with
zero to five years’ experience), mid-career pay (pay among
workers with 10 or more years’ experience), pay growth, job
satisfaction, job stress, job meaning and job-market projections
from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. PayScale weighs those
factors equally to create an overall rating for each degree.

Drawing information from 145,536 salary profiles,
PayScale created two lists that capture the 45 best and worst
degrees. Biomedical engineering takes the top spot in the best MS
degree category. Professionals in this field “combine engineering
principles with medical and biological sciences to design and
create equipment, devices, computer systems, and software used in
healthcare,” according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics 
( https://www.bls.gov/ooh/architecture-and-engineering/biomedical-engineers.htm )
. PayScale’s analysis shows that, among those with biomedical
engineering master’s degrees, compensation leaps from $70,200 at
the early-career stage to $129,300 by mid-career. These graduates
also go on to derive high satisfaction and meaning from their
jobs."
