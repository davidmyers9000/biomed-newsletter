        <p class="lead">"A master’s program can be a great way to switch careers or build momentum in your current track. But it’s important to think hard about what you’ll get out of a graduate degree before you make the investment, because some master's degrees are much more valuable than others.</p>

        <p>Every year, Forbes turns to compensation site PayScale to reveal the best and worst master’s degrees for jobs. <%= link_to "PayScale", "http://www.payscale.com/" %> creates a sophisticated ranking that uses seven factors: early career pay (median pay for workers with zero to five years’ experience), mid-career pay (pay among workers with 10 or more years’ experience), pay growth, job satisfaction, job stress, job meaning and job-market projections from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. PayScale weighs those factors equally to create an overall rating for each degree.</p>

        <p>Drawing information from 145,536 salary profiles, PayScale created two lists that capture the 45 best and worst degrees. Biomedical engineering takes the top spot in the best MS degree category. Professionals in this field “combine engineering principles with medical and biological sciences to design and create equipment, devices, computer systems, and software used in healthcare,” according to the <%= link_to "Bureau of Labor Statistics", "https://www.bls.gov/ooh/architecture-and-engineering/biomedical-engineers.htm" %>. PayScale’s analysis shows that, among those with biomedical engineering master’s degrees, compensation leaps from $70,200 at the early-career stage to $129,300 by mid-career. These graduates also go on to derive high satisfaction and meaning from their jobs."</p>
