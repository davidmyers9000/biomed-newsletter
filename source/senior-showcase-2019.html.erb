        <h3 class="small" style="color: #006699;">Biomed Senior Celebration and Showcase</h3>
        <p><strong>Behrakis Grand Hall</strong></p>
        <p>Join us to celebrate our graduating BS, MS, and PhD students! This event seeks to showcase the highly innovative biomedical design projects of our graduating seniors and their interdisciplinary teammates in celebration of their senior year capstone design achievements. Many of these endeavors started with clinical shadowing to identify unmet medical needs, followed by rigorous engineering design of a novel solution, iterations of prototypes, and testing of the built solution. These exciting projects address unmet therapeutic needs and quality-of-life altering, real-world problems through design innovation. During this event, students will also compete for Design and Innovation Awards supported by the School of Biomedical Engineering, Science and Health Systems and your generous donations.</p>
        <p><em>Hors d'oeuvres and non-alcoholic beverages will be served during the event.</em></p>
