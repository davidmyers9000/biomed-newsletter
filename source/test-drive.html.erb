                    Dr. Kara Spiller is an Assistant Professor in Drexel University's School of Biomedical Engineering, Science, and Health Systems. A member of the first class of Drexel's accelerated BS/PhD program, Dr. Spiller received bachelor's and master's degrees in biomedical engineering from Drexel University in 2007. As an NSF Graduate Research Fellow, she conducted her doctoral research in the design of semi-degradable hydrogels for the repair of articular cartilage in the Biomaterials and Drug Delivery Laboratory at Drexel (PI: A. Lowman) and in the Shanghai Key Tissue Engineering Laboratory of Shanghai Jiao Tong University (PI: W. Liu). After completing her PhD in 2010, she conducted research in the design of scaffolds for bone tissue engineering on a Fulbright fellowship in the Biomaterials, Biodegradables, and Biomimetics (the 3Bs) Research Group at the University of Minho in Guimaraes, Portugal (PI: R.L Reis). She then conducted postdoctoral studies towards the development of immunomodulatory biomaterials for bone regeneration in the Laboratory for Stem Cells and Tissue Engineering at Columbia University (PI: G. Vunjak-Novakovic), before returning to Drexel in 2013. Her current research interests include cell-biomaterial interactions, the design of immunomodulatory biomaterials, and international engineering education. Dr. Spiller is looking for graduate students to join her laboratory in the Fall of 2017!
