        <p>Dear Friends, </p>
        <p>As the end of our fiscal year approaches, I reflect on the many amazing successes we have accomplished here at the School of Biomedical Engineering, Science and Health Systems. As the inaugural dean, I am proud of our talented students and faculty, and I want to share a few of those stories with you. </p>
        <p>Bob Schultz is a current PhD student, who works under the advisement of Yinghui Zhong, PhD. Bob’s research aims to regenerate spinal cord tissue. In addition to conducing groundbreaking research, Bob, like many other of our students, also serves our community in West Philadelphia by sharing his expertise in teaching and mentoring grade school students in science and engineering. </p>
        <p class="margin-bottom-fix">I’m also proud of Carli Moorehead, a BS/MS student in our School who is working on a project titled “Developing ‘Smart’ Bone Implant Materials for Improved Regeneration and Repair” with Simone Spiro, PhD. Carli and Dr. Spiro will work on the project at the Institute of Science and Technology in Ceramics in Faneza, Italy. They will be working on iron-doped hydroxyapatite nanoparticles and scaffolds to tune magnetic and biological properties for drug delivery and bone tissue engineering. Carli is also one of three Drexel Biomed students that have been awarded a prestigious Fulbright US Student Program Grant for the 2017-18 academic year. </p>
        <div class="p-space">&nbsp;</div>
        <p>These stories are just a sampling of the astounding achievements our students and faculty members have been able to accomplish in the past year. </p>
        <p>As we reflect on our accomplishments, I hope you will join me and hundreds of other donors in supporting the School through a personal gift to ensure our successes continue well into the future. Please find a return enveloped enclosed, or give online at <a href="http://drexel.edu/biomed/about/make-a-gift/">drexel.edu/biomed</a>. If you would like to discuss giving via phone or in-person, please contact my colleague <a href="mailto:lauren.anglum@drexel.edu">Lauren Anglum</a> at <a href="mailto:lauren.anglum@drexel.edu">lauren.anglum@drexel.edu</a>.</p>
