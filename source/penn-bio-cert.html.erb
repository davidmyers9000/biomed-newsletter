          <strong style="color: #006699;">Extensive molecular and biological patient data is increasingly included in diagnosis and treatment and its interpretation is crucial for the future of precision and personalized medicine.</strong> The increasing adoption of genomic and new genomic data sequencing in clinical labs requires that healthcare professionals, in particular physicians, be equipped with the knowledge and skills to understand and interpret genomic and other high-throughput ‘omics data for patient care.<sup>1</sup>

          The Advanced Certificate in Bioinformatics at the School of Biomedical Engineering, Science and Health Systems at Drexel University enables post-bac students to gain the bioinformatics expertise prior to formal medical education, thus making the participants aware of computational tools and techniques available to them very early in their medical training.<sup>1</sup>
        </p>
        <p>
          The Advanced Certificate in Bioinformatics at the School of Biomedical Engineering, Science and Health Systems at Drexel University emphasizes a systems engineering approach to provide a foundation in systems biology and pathology informatics (tailored specifically to students with post-bac/pre-med background). Students are provided with hands-on experience in the application of genomic, proteomic, and other large-scale information to biomedical engineering, as well as experience in advanced computational methods used in systems biology. The Certificate includes 4 courses and an optional research component and can be completed in one year.
