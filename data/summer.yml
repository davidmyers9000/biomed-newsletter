        Amy Throckmorton, associate professor, Ken Barbee, professor and deputy director, and Kara Spiller, assistant professor, all in BIOMED, are members of two 'dream teams' of investigators who will shape innovative solutions to address unmet pediatric medical needs, as part of a research partnership with The Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP), Drexel University, and The Hebrew University of Jerusalem. The joint projects each will receive $250K over two years in institutional funding, as administrators seek external investors interested in advancing exciting pediatric translational research with commercial viability. One dream team will be based at Drexel, with Dr. Throckmorton as the principal investigator of the “Giving Kids a Chance” project that will investigate a new intravascular blood pump for pediatric patients with congenital heart disease (CHD). Drs. Barbee and Spiller are members of a second dream team based at CHOP, with Robert J. Levy, MD, as the principal investigator of a research project titled “Pediatric Transcatheter Valve Replacements: Preventing Device Failure due to Structural Degeneration" that also will focus on CHD with a concentration on Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF). These “blue babies” have insufficient oxygen and need cardiac surgery early in life.

        Dr. Joshua Jacobs, assistant professor in BIOMED, will join a $22.5 million, 4-year research project titled “Restoring Active Memory,” in which he will explore the use of brain stimulation to help recover memories and cognitive abilities of people who have suffered a traumatic brain injury. The research is funded by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) and is affiliated with President Barack Obama’s Brain Research through Advancing Innovative Neurotechnologies initiative. This large-scale project is coordinated among seven hospital sites, including Thomas Jefferson University (TJU), the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania, Dartmouth University, Emory University, NIH, the Mayo Clinic, and the University of Washington. Dr. Jacobs is involved in the TJU hospital site.
