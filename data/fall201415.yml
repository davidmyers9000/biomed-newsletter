        Dr. Justin Lathia, alumnus in BIOMED and assistant professor in the 
        Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, was recently honored 
        with a $600K 4-year Distinguished Scientist Award from the Sontag 
        Foundation for a brain-cancer-related research project. The award is 
        given to young scientists whose research is likely to improve the 
        quality of life of patients with brain cancer. Dr. Lathia will use the 
        funds to study how cancer stem cells, a population of cells that drive 
        tumor growth and resistance to therapy, interact with the immune system 
        in glioblastoma, the deadliest type of brain tumor. For the full story,
