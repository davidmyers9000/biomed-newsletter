        Dr. Kara Spiller Receives an NSF Grant for a US–Australia 
        Collaborative Research Project

        Dr. Kara Spiller, assistant professor in BIOMED, received a 1-year $45K NSF 
        grant for the project titled “US–Australia Collaborative Research: 
        Research Planning and Proof-of-Concept Study of Macrophage-Scaffold 
        Interactions" to investigate the interactions between cells of the human 
        inflammatory response with novel ceramic scaffolds developed by Dr. Hala 
        Zreiqat of the University of Sydney.
      - >
        The ceramic scaffolds have been shown to be extremely successful at 
        inducing bone regeneration in preclinical studies. This project 
        investigates the hypothesis that the mechanism behind their success 
        is positive interactions with the inflammatory response, which is the 
        focus of Dr. Spiller's laboratory. This grant, funded by the NSF 
        Catalyzing International Collaborations (CNIC) program, supports the 
        exchange of doctoral students between Sydney University and Drexel 
        University to conduct this research. Pamela Graney, a doctoral student 
        in Dr. Spiller's laboratory at Drexel, will spend four months in Dr. 
        Zreiqat's lab in Sydney this fall, and one of Dr. Zreiqat's students 
        will visit Drexel next spring."

        as part of a research partnership with The Children’s Hospital of 
        Philadelphia (CHOP), Drexel University, and The Hebrew University of 
        Jerusalem. The joint projects each will receive $250K over two years 
        in institutional funding, as administrators seek external investors 
        interested in advancing exciting pediatric translational research with 
        commercial viability. One dream team will be based at Drexel, with Dr. 
        Throckmorton as the principal investigator of the “Giving Kids a 
        Chance” project that will investigate a new intravascular blood pump 
        for pediatric patients with congenital heart disease (CHD). Drs. 
        Barbee and Spiller are members of a second dream team based at CHOP, 
        with Robert J. Levy, MD, as the principal investigator of a research 
        project titled “Pediatric Transcatheter Valve Replacements: 
        Preventing Device Failure due to Structural Degeneration" that also 
        will focus on CHD with a concentration on Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF). 
        These “blue babies” have insufficient oxygen and need cardiac surgery 
        early in life.

        Dr. Joshua Jacobs, assistant professor in BIOMED, will join a $22.5 
        million, 4-year research project titled “Restoring Active Memory,” in 
        which he will explore the use of brain stimulation to help recover 
        memories and cognitive abilities of people who have suffered a 
        traumatic brain injury. The research is funded by the Defense Advanced 
        Research Projects Agency (DARPA) and is affiliated with President 
        Barack Obama’s Brain Research through Advancing Innovative 
        Neurotechnologies initiative. This large-scale project is coordinated 
        among seven hospital sites, including Thomas Jefferson University 
        (TJU), the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania, Dartmouth 
        University, Emory University, NIH, the Mayo Clinic, and the University 
        of Washington. Dr. Jacobs is involved in the TJU hospital site.

        Drs. Yinghui Zhong, assistant professor in BIOMED (Co-PI), Simon 
        Giszter (CoM – PI), and Denise Garcia (CoM – Co-PI), received a 
        1-year $75K Philadelphia Health Education Corporation (PHEC) grant 
        for the project "In-vivo 2 Photon Imaging of Neural Plasticity in 
        Mouse Cortex to Compare Chronic Responses to the Drexel Braided 
        Electrodes vs. Standard Microwires, with and without Hydrogel Delivered 
        Trophins." The goal of the project is to study chronic tissue response 
        and brain tissue integration of novel brain electrodes by releasing 
        neurotrophins using non-invasive in-vivo 2-photo imaging so the brain-
        electrode interface is not disrupted.
