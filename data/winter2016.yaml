    Translational Design Clinical Immersion Co-op
  text: >
    The Translational Design Clinical Immersion Co-op is part of an innovative new Junior Design / Senior Design program in the School of Biomedical Engineering, Sciences and Health Systems.  This program, funded by the National Institutes of Health, gives students, during their junior year, the opportunity to spend their co-op cycle working alongside clinicians and biomedical engineers to identify unmet clinical needs and translate novel technologies from bench to bedside.

    Dr. Margaret Wheatley, John M. Reid Professor in BIOMED, received a 1-year $100K W.W. Smith Charitable Trust Award for the project titled, "Creating a New Paradigm for Pancreatic Cancer Treatment." The goal of this project is to design "stealth" microbubbles that evade the immune system and deliver gemcitabine from nanoparticles created in situ, directly to the tumor, thereby overcoming problems with dense tissue around tumors. Success could usher in a new era of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) treatment, bringing a population that is considered unresectable within reach of a cure.
