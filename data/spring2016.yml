    Amanda Pentecost, dual PhD candidate in MSE and MS in BIOMED (Advisors: Y. Gogotsi and K. Spiller), was awarded a 2016 Whitaker International Fellowship to conduct research with Dr. Kwangmeyung Kim at the Center for Theragnosis, housed in the Biomedical Research Institute at the Korea Institute of Science and Technology (KIST) in Seoul, South Korea. Amanda's dissertation research focuses on using theranostic nanoparticles to increase the effectiveness of a common anti-inflammatory drug, dexamethasone, in preventing fibrous capsule formation and isolation of an implanted biomaterial. She has been designing and characterizing this novel drug delivery system, as well as testing it on a cellular lever. At KIST, Amanda will have access to high-level expertise and state-of-the-art microscopy and microscopic equipment needed to monitor the real-time distribution of nanoparticles within the body as well as their effectiveness in preventing fibrosis.

    Drs. Karen Moxon, professor and associate director for research in BIOMED (PI), and John Bethea (CoAS – Co-PI), received a 5-year mult-PI $3M NIH R01 grant for the project titled “Enhancing Supraspinal Plasticity to Improve Functional Recovery After SCI.” It is becoming increasingly evident that plasticity within supraspinal networks, induced by therapeutic interventions, is necessary for optimal recovery of function after spinal cord injury. The goal of this project is to study the impact of a range of novel therapeutic interventions on neuronal and glial plasticity in the central nervous system to understand how to improve behavioral outcomes after severe, mid-thoracic spinal cord injury.
